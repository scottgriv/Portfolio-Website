ðŸš€ The CREDITS Generator is a straightforward tool designed to help you quickly create a CREDITS.md file for acknowledging contributions to your project. Simply input details of contributors, third-party libraries, financial supporters, and special thanks, then review or edit the preview. Once satisfied, download the CREDITS.md file and place it in the root (or .github folder) of your GitHub repository to transparently showcase all project contributions.

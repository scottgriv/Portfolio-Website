A Python, Django, Plotly, and Pandas web application that visualizes river data pulled using an API from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The application allows users to view a river's gage height and discharge based on a specific date range. The application also allows users to view plotted dates of interest on the graph to view river levels for said dates.

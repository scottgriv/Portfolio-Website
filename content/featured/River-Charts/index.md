A Python, Django, Plotly, and Pandas web application that visualizes river data pulled using an API from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The application allows users to set a river and a date range to view the river's gage height and discharge. The application also allows users to plot dates of interest on the graph and view the data for those dates.
